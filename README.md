# gpx-bot
Telegram bot for working with favourite places saved in gpx files

The initial motivation behind this project comes from trying to
automatize as much as possible the synchronization of the OsmAnd
Android application in my phone with the gpx files generated in my
computer with my Emacs package
[orgpx](https://github.com/igmacs/orgpx). For that I decided to use
Telegram as a cloud, [telega](https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el) on
the Emacs side, and Telegram notifications to remind me to synchronize
manually on the phone when needed. But then I thought that I could
just as well make it it my first toy Telegram bot and add interesting
features to operate over the gpx file with my favourite places. This
project is the result of that.
